# ZXBasic git - the really quick guide
blah blah blah why use github  - collaboration and stuff
Intro by David


## Getting started
The ZXBasic repository is located here: https://github.com/thomasheckmann/ZXBasic/

### Browse code
If you just want to browse the repository and have a peek of whats going on, you can do fine with the web interface on [Github](https://github.com/thomasheckmann/ZXBasic/).

### Participate and submit code
If you want to participate, contribute code or just play around with the code for yourself, you will need a **git client** on your local machine and a github account (it's free as in free beer).

The following options are recommended:
* Windows
	* Desktop Client [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)
	* Git for Windows (includes Command line version) [here](https://git-for-windows.github.io/)
* OSX
	* Desktop Client [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)
	* Command line git (out-of-the-box)
* Linux / Unix
	* Command line git (usually out-of-the-box)

## Checkout the ZXBasic repository
To create a working local copy where all your local work will be maintained, clone the repository:

### Command line 'git'
```
git clone https://github.com/thomasheckmann/ZXBasic.git
```
You should now have a local directory *ZXBasic* with all the code from the repository. *NOTE* This is your own local copy, you can do all kind of changes without affecting the general repository.

### GitHub Desktop
With the GitHub Desktop it is only possible to clone repositories associated to your account. If you don't have access to the ZXBasic repository from your account, you first need to fork the ZXBasic repository into your own repository.
